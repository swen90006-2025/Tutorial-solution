    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to get you thinking about software security\n",
    "and vulnerabilities, and the applicability of different kinds of\n",
    "security testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, think about what security testing is, and why we would\n",
    "want to perform security testing on our software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordinary program testing seeks to uncover program faults, exhibited by failures: when the program's observable behaviour differs from what it was intended or required to do. In contrast, security testing seeks to uncover security *vulnerabilities*: typically extra functionality that allows an attacker to do something unwanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This \"something unwanted\" could include the attacker:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Causing the program to crash (perhaps denying service,\n",
    "        i.e. *availability*, to other users);\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Causing the program to corrupt data (violating data *integrity*);\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Causing the program to reveal sensitive data (violating data\n",
    "        *confidentiality*);\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Causing the program to take an excessive amount of time to execute\n",
    "        (degrading performance and possibly affecting availability for other\n",
    "        users);\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Causing the program to execute attacker-controlled functionality (in\n",
    "        the worst case, arbitrary attacker-supplied code).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The prevalence of security *patching*, where software upgrades are\n",
    "periodically released to address security vulnerabilities, indicates how\n",
    "difficult it is to program software without security vulnerabilities\n",
    "and, therefore, the importance of testing for them. The potential cost\n",
    "of an attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities, in an age where\n",
    "software routinely manages and processes huge bodies of users' personal\n",
    "information, only makes the case for security testing stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. While the unwanted functionality is usually extra functionality,\n",
    "unintended by the program's specification or requirements, remember that\n",
    "by testing for common kinds of unwanted behaviour (e.g. program crashes,\n",
    "undefined behaviour, information leaks etc.), security testing (as with\n",
    "ordinary testing) can also uncover vulnerabilities that exist in a\n",
    "program's specification or design."
